## Journal 1 - When does a physical system compute?
From what I can understand of this paper it proposes a question on 'When a physical system computes', it then turns towards theoretical pyhsics and mathematics to try and answer the question. 

## Journal 2 - Experimental Investigations of the Utility of Detailed Flowcharts in Programming
The text from what I can tell argues the pros and cons about the use of a flowchart and if they are still as integral. They then explain various tests that they ran on a small sample group and the results that they recieved. Which can be summarized as such:
>We conjecture that detailed flowcharts are merely a redundant presentation of the information contained in the programming language statements. The flowcharts may even be at a disadvantage because they are not as complete (omitting declarations, statement labels, and input/output formats) and require many more pages than do the concise programming language statements.

This paper proposes that
